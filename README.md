## Customization

To customize the website for your own use:

Content Updates:

Open each component file in the src/components directory (e.g., Hero.js, About.js, Services.js, etc.).
Update the text content within these files to reflect your personal information, skills, and experiences.


Styling Changes:

Global styles are located in src/styles/index.css. Modify the CSS variables in the :root selector to change the color scheme:
cssCopy:root {
  --primary-color: #FF6B00;
  --text-color: #FFFFFF;
  --background-color: #121212;
  --secondary-background: #1E1E1E;
  --card-background: #242424;
}

Each component has its own CSS file in the src/styles directory. Modify these to adjust component-specific styles.


Images:

Replace the images in the public/images directory with your own. Make sure to maintain the same file names or update the image paths in the component files.


Projects:

Update the Projects.js file to showcase your own projects. Modify the project data structure as needed.


Testimonials:

In the Testimonials.js file, update the testimonial data with your own client feedback.


Contact Information:

Modify the Contact.js component to include your preferred contact method (e.g., email, contact form, social media links).


Meta Information:

Update the public/index.html file to change the website title, description, and other meta tags.


Loading Screen:

If you want to modify the loading experience, adjust the Loading.js component and the useEffect hook in App.js.


Adding New Sections:

To add a new section, create a new component in the src/components directory.
Import the new component in App.js and add it to the render method.
Create a corresponding CSS file in src/styles and import it in App.js.



Remember to test your changes thoroughly, especially on different device sizes to ensure responsiveness.
